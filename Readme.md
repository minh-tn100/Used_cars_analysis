When selling used cars, it's crucial to consider several factors that can significantly influence the price of a car. These factors include:

1. **Aging (Age):** The age of a car is one of the primary determinants of its price. Older cars typically have a lower market value compared to newer ones.

2. **Transmission:** The type of transmission, whether it's manual or automatic, can impact a car's price. Automatic transmissions are often preferred and may command a higher price.

3. **Odometer (km):** The mileage on a car's odometer is a critical factor. Lower mileage often means less wear and tear, which can lead to a higher selling price.

4. **Number of Cylinders:** The engine configuration, specifically the number of cylinders, affects a car's performance and fuel efficiency. Cars with more cylinders may have higher prices due to their potential for better performance.

Consider these factors carefully when pricing your used cars, as they play a significant role in attracting potential buyers and determining the final sale price.

### Factor 1: Car age 
#### Sales Trends by Car Age

The graphic below illustrates the sales trends based on the age of cars. It highlights that the highest level of sales is observed for cars with an age of 9 years, followed closely by cars aged 10 years and 8 years.

This chart will provide valuable insights into how different transmission types impact the pricing of used cars.

When it comes to the transmission types in the used car market, statistics show that automatic transmissions dominate the scene, accounting for a substantial 90% of used car sales. Manual and other transmission types, on the other hand, represent a minor portion of the market.

**Recommendation:** Considering this market trend, it is advisable for used car dealers to focus their business primarily on vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions. This alignment with the prevailing consumer preference can help optimize sales and cater to the broader demand for automatic transmission vehicles.

### Factor 3: Odometer(km)

#### Odometer(km)/Price Chart

To gain a better understanding of how odometer readings in kilometers (km) correlate with car prices, please consult the chart provided below:

This chart will help illustrate the relationship between odometer readings and the pricing of used cars.

#### Odometer Range for Optimal Used Car Sales

For optimal results in selling used cars, it's crucial to consider the odometer reading. The "Good range" of odometer readings falls between 70,000 km and 160,000 km. Within this range, you can expect to sell used cars quite effectively.

However, it's essential to note that when the odometer reading falls below 70,000 km or rises above 160,000 km, the number of sold cars significantly decreases. Buyers tend to favor vehicles within this specific mileage range, as it often indicates a well-balanced usage history and, consequently, a higher level of interest in the market.


### Factor 4: Number of Cylinders

In assessing used car pricing, one crucial factor to consider is the number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine. This factor can have a significant impact on both performance and market demand. The chart below provides an overview of the distribution of cars by the number of cylinders:
